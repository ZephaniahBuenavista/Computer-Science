Recently in my computer science class we worked with turtles in python. Turtles is a program in python used to draw things in the program you have a turtle that will move in a certain way depending on what you tell it to do in a line. I was assigned a task to create something using turtles and with that I thought of a few ideas that I could do and I chose to draw a turtle. I chose this topic because I believe it was doable and somewhat difficult. As I worked on drawing the turtle I had some difficulty on drawing the back because it had a bunch of shapes and would take along time to draw an accurate one so I simplified it to just one pentagon with lines.  With all that done I was able to finish the drawing and I was able to turn it in.
